      Folk culture is a cultural tradition created and shared by generations of people in a specific region. 
      It is the national culture created, inherited, and developed by the general public in long-term social life. 
      It has a wide range of scope, including the material culture, spiritual culture, 
      and social organizations (such as families, villages, and various forms of social aggregation) 
      we often talk about.

    </a>
    <p>
      During the Covid-19 pandemic, when the government ended the lock-down policy,
      many people started to catch the Covid-19. 
      Nucleic acid testing, atigen detection...when the result of these tests are "positive",
      which means the person catches the Covid-19. 
      But Chinese people always avoid talking about the disease and pain directly. 
      Therefore, they say "I'm a sheep" instead of "I'm positive", because "sheep" pronounces the same as "positive" in Chinese.
      <br/>
      In this special exhibition, there are illustrations generated from the people I know who say "I'm a sheep" in social media.

    <h2>About this exhibition关于本展览</h2>
    <p>
      This is an exhibition about Chinese traditional folk culture.
      Folk culture influences the behavior and thinking of Chinese people unconsciously.
      In this exhibition, I use some pictures from my real life, 
      which represent how folk culture influence Chinese people's life,
      to generate illustration by AI.
      All the illustration above are generated by AI (dream.ai, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion...). 
      Also, I made this webpage with ChatGPT. 
      It constructed the framework of the webpage and chose the theme color of this webpage.
      <br/>
      I hope you can know more about Chinese folk culture through this exhibition. 
      Also, I hope you can recognize the influence from the traditional thinking.
      <br/>
      If you want to know more, you can check Dr. Wan Jianzhong's books and works. 
      I read his book and learned a lot.
